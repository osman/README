# osman.README [wip]

## What is this?

This document is a quick way to
 - introduce myself
 - identify my thoughts and values
 - set expectations on how you can depend on me as your co-worker
 
We will get to know each other much better in the coming months so hopefully this helps to speed up that process. This isn't a substitute for us actually getting to know each other and feedback is extremely encouraged.

## Who am I?

Hi, I'm Osman.

I was born in Hong Kong and emigrated to Canada at the age of three. I went to University of Waterloo to get a degree in Electrical Engineering. Early in, I found that I enjoyed software development much more than power systems or circuits, so I graduated with an option in Computer Engineering as well.

After graduation, I joined a small startup in Waterloo to start the Analytics team. We were acquired by Blackberry within my first year of joining and I ended up on a slightly larger Analytics team building features that improved context for meetings, gave you suggestions when creating emails, etc. After a while, I found myself longing to work on larger projects and make a bigger impact within the organization. At the 3 year mark, I decided to once again jump into a small startup as their first developer. Over the next five years, I was given the opportunity help design a SaaS product that powers some of the largest e-commerce sites in the world and build a development team from the ground up.

Now for the "fun" stuff. I enjoy all racket sports and you will usually find me in a climbing gym at least once a week. When not being active, I love spending time with friends and family. My wife (Jenn) and I love travelling; trying new foods and restaurants (lots of them tend to be sushi); and we just got a puppy (Milo). I consider myself skewed towards introversion, so interactions with large crowds (5+ people) tend to tire me out. Small hangouts are more my thing.
